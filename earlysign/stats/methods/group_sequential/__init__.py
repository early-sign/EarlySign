"""
Group sequential testing methods and procedures.

This module provides implementations of group sequential testing approaches
for controlled sequential analysis with pre-specified stopping boundaries.

The core mathematical functions for group sequential testing including
error spending functions and boundary calculations are available in the
`core` module.
