"""
Statistical theories and methodologies for sequential testing.

This module contains the theoretical frameworks that define how
statistical tests should behave, including:

- Group Sequential Testing theory
- Safe Testing methodology
- Sequential Probability Ratio Tests
- Other statistical theories

These methods define the statistical behavior but are independent
of specific problem domains or data types.

Available methods:
- `group_sequential`: Group sequential testing with spending functions
- `safe_testing`: E-value based safe testing methods
- `common`: Common statistical utilities across methods
