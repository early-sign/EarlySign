"""
Problem-specific implementations for experimental scenarios.

This module contains concrete implementations that combine mathematical
foundations and statistical methods to solve specific experimental problems:

- A/B testing with binary outcomes (two_proportions)
- Continuous metric experiments
- Survival analysis experiments
- Multi-armed bandit problems
- Guardrail monitoring schemes

These schemes are the user-facing implementations that practitioners
configure for their specific experimental needs.

Available schemes:
- `two_proportions`: Two-proportion testing schemes for A/B tests
