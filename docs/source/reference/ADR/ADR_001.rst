ADR-001: `__init__.py` for documentation
==========================================

**Status**: `Proposed` | **`Accepted`** | `Deprecated` | `Superseded`

📋 Context
-----------
Our codebase can leverage Python's implicit namespace packages, which do not require ``__init__.py`` files. However, this modern feature poses a compatibility challenge for our documentation toolchain. Specifically, ``sphinx-autoapi`` fails to correctly discover and map the package structure without the presence of ``__init__.py`` files, leading to incomplete API references.

💡 Decision
------------
We will explicitly include an ``__init__.py`` file in every package directory.

While the primary motivation is to ensure compatibility with ``sphinx-autoapi``, we will also leverage these files to improve our documentation. The docstring within each ``__init__.py`` will serve as the landing page for its respective module in the API reference, providing a high-level overview.

✨ Consequences
-----------------
**Positive:**
* ✅ **Reliable Doc Generation:** Guarantees that our API documentation is generated correctly and completely by Sphinx.
* 📚 **Improved Readability:** The API reference for each package will start with a helpful summary, making the library easier to navigate for users.
* 🧐 **Clear Package Boundaries:** Explicitly marks directories as packages, leaving no room for ambiguity.

**Negative:**
* 📂 **Slight File Increase:** Adds a number of empty or near-empty files to the repository.
